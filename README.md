## Maxun Integration

CouncilInsight can integrate with the Maxun web scraping service to automatically collect council meeting data.

### Maxun Service Setup

1. Install Maxun (if not using the provided Docker container):
   ```bash
   npm install -g maxun
   ```

2. Configure Maxun with your scraping robots:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p maxun/robots
   # Add robot definitions to the robots directory
   ```

3. Start Maxun service:
   ```bash
   maxun start --port 8080
   ```

### Connecting CouncilInsight to Maxun

1. Set the Maxun URL and authentication in your environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_MAXUN_URL=http://localhost:8080
   VITE_MAXUN_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

2. Use the Data Ingestion page in CouncilInsight to:
   - View available robots
   - Run robots manually
   - Check job status
   - Import data from completed jobs

### Robot Development

To create new scraping robots for Maxun:

1. Create a new robot definition file in `maxun/robots/`
2. Define the scraping logic following Maxun's robot format
3. Restart the Maxun service to load the new robot
4. Access the robot through the CouncilInsight Data Ingestion page

## Deployment

CouncilInsight supports multiple deployment options, with the recommended approach being a dual-deployment to Vercel and Google Cloud Run. See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
